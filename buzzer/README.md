This game is designed to be interacted with via a game show buzzer plugged into
the USB port.  The first buzzer was built into the OSOYOO Pro Micro ATmega32U4
board found on (Amazon)[https://www.amazon.com/OSOYOO-ATmega32U4-arduino-Leonardo-ATmega328/dp/B012FOV17O/].

`buzzer.ino` is written to use the Arduino Leonardo board, as it supports acting
as a Keyboard HID.
